Term/Concept 1: Online APIs

Definition: An online API are rules and protocols that facilitate communication and interaction between software applications, facilitating seamless integration and data exchange in web development.  

My Understanding (Rate 1-5): 4  

Example/Application: API is to compare it to a waiter in a restaurant. Just as a waiter serves as an intermediary between the customer and the kitchen, taking orders from the customer and delivering them to the kitchen, and then bringing the prepared food back to the customer, an API acts as an intermediary between different software components or systems. It receives requests from one software application, processes them according to predefined rules, accesses the necessary resources or data, and then returns the results to the requesting application.


Term/Concept 2: cURL

Definition: cURL is a command-line tool for transferring data using various network protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, LDAP, TELNET, DICT, FILE, IMAP, POP3, and SMTP, used for web page fetching, file uploading, and API interaction.

My Understanding (Rate 1-5): 3  

Example/Application: cURL is like a courier service. Just as a courier service transports packages between different locations upon request, cURL transfers data between a client and a server over the internet. It handles the logistics of making requests, sending them over the appropriate protocol, and delivering the responses back to the client, much like how a courier service handles the transportation of packages from sender to recipient.


Term/Concept 3: RESTful API

Definition: RESTful API is a networked application architecture that emphasizes statelessness, allowing resources to be accessed and manipulated using predefined operations over HTTP, ensuring scalability and reliability.

My Understanding (Rate 1-5): 3 

Example/Application: A RESTful API is a library catalog system that simplifies interactions between clients and servers by providing endpoints for resources and operations, allowing patrons to search for and access books, and using HTTP methods for actions like borrowing or updating.
